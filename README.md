Final Project for C220

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam.

When we considered the theme of coronavirus, we thought about it this way: we want to make a fun game based on what is happening today. We know that the situation is tragic and we are aware of the tragedy that has occured. This is not to offend anyone it was just a game made for a class project.

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: we are not good at programming so we decided to recreate a project that we knew would fit the theme of the project. 

These are the technologies and resources we used: Godot3.2

This is the objective of the game: INfect the other countries befor you lose your lives.

This is how the game is played: move the pong and bounce the virus off of you and onto other countries

Future plans: Make the game harder and add more interesting features for the tiles when they spawn in.

The contributions of each teammate: Mark Hannah: programing game Charles Herron: Music and general idea Andy Manzur: Game design and programinig
